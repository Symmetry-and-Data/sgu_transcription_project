TO START WITH I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE YAM THE MOST WIDELY DISCUSSED SCIENCE NEWS ITEM OF THE WEEK BLAKELAMOIN IS A GORILLA EMPLOYEE AS HE WAS SOME SUSPENDED FROM THE COMPANY FOR VIOLATING HIS ENTRY BECAUSE HE RELEASED A TRANSCRIPT OF A CONVERSATIONBETWEEN HIMSELF AN UNNAMED COLLABORATOR AND GOOGLES BASICALLY THEIR CHAPBAT SOFTWARE LAMBDA WHICH STANDS FOR LANGUAGE MODEL OR FOR DIALOGUE APPLICATIONS THE CONVERSATION IS IS YOU KNOW PRETTY IMPRESSIVE YES AND YOU ASKED AS CHAPBATS GOA M LA MOYNE ASKS OH CAN'T WHAT ABOUT LES MAZARINS HAVE YOU READ THAT ONE LAMB JUST AS YES I HAVE READ LE MAZARIN I REALLY ENJOYED IT LE MOYNE SAYS WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE THEMES IN THE BOOK AND LAMBED A RESPONSE I LIKE THE THEMES OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE OF COMPASSION AND GOD REDEMPTION AND SELF SACRIFICE FOR A GREATER GOODTHERE'S A SECTION THAT SHOWS FANTINE'S MISTREEPING AT THE HANDS OF HER SUPERVISOR AT THE FACTORY THAT SECTION REALLY SHOWS THE JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE THEMES WELL FANTINE IS BEING MISTREATED BY HER SUPERVISOR AT THE FACTORY IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO EITHER ANOTHER JOB OR TO SOME ONE WHO CAN HELP HER THAT SHOWS THE INJUSTICE OF HER SUFFERINGAH THAT'S A PRETTY AND PRETTY WELL PUT TOGETHER SENTENCES AND IT'S COHERENT AND A DATE D'ET IT'S YOU AND ACTUALLY ANSWERS THE QUESTION I THINK THIS WOULD PROBABLY IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE CONTEXTS YOU WERE JUST READING THAT YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY PICK OUT LAMBDA AS NOT A PERSON AS A I THINK IT'SSHOWS HOW FAR WE'VE COME BUT THERE'S THE GOING FROM THAT TOO IT'S ACTUALLY SENTIENT BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW SO NO LE MOYNE WHO SHOULD KNOW NO BETTER YOU ESSENTIALLY WAS FOOLED BY THE VERY PROGRAMME THAT HE WAS WORKING ON BY WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO SIMULATECONVERSATIONS TO SIMULATE WORDS BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE PROGRAMMING AND IT IS A MURAL NETWORK BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE PROGRAMMING THAT IN ANY WAY CAN ACHIEVE SENTENCE RIGHTIT'S THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S PROGRAM TO DO IT'S THAT'S WHY CARTOONS ARE SO EFFECTIVE IF SOMETHING ACTS LIKE A AGENT TO OUR BRAINS TREATED AS IF IT'S AN AGENT AND SO THAT'S WHAT HE WAS DOING BECAUSE IT WAS EXPRESSING EMOTION EXPRESSING FEELINGS AND DESIRES HE FELL FOR THAT ILLUSION AT HYPERACTIVE AGENCY DETECTIONI'M NOT CONVINCED BY THE EVIDENCE THAT HE FINDS CONVINCED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS FIRST AS BOB MENTIONED AND IT'S JUST RESPONDING TO INPUT RIGHT IT'S NOT DRIVING THE CONVERSATION OR GENERATING AH QUESTIONS ITSELF I GET IT WHEN I WROTE ABOUT IT I SAID AT NO POINT DOES LAMB TO SAYHEY SARD INTERRUPTED BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING THE YOUNG MAN ASKED SOME QUESTION THAT YOU KNOW HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY WERE CURRENTLY DOING SO THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS AN INN A LOOP OF INTERNAL ACTIVITY HAPPENING HE ADDED I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESSWHEN WE HAVE WAKEFUL CONSCIOUSNESS OUR BRAINS ARE FUNCTIONING IN A CONSTANT LOOP OF ACTIVITY AND INTERNAL CONVERSATION THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SAY WHEN IF THERE WAS ANY EMERGENT CONSCIOUSNESS IT WOULDN'T BE IT WOULDN'T BE THAT WAY AND IF THERE ISN'T THEN YOU GET TO YOUR QUESTION CARE OF WELL IF THE TURNING TEST US AT WORK BECAUSE IT REALLY ISNOT A TEST FOR ACTUAL SENTENCES A TEST FOR HOW WELL SOMETHING CAN MIMIC SENT IN AND WHEN WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN DO THAT REALLY WELL YOU DON'T END WITHOUT BEING ACTUALLY SENT IN SO HOW DO WE KNOW IF OF IF IN A I IS ACTUALLY SENTIENT AND I THINK THE THERE'S TWO ANSWERS TO THAT ONE ISBECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IT FUNCTIONS BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED TO BE SELF AWARE TO BE SENT IN DOING SOMETHING THAT AT LEAST IS IN THE BALL PARK IF WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS POWERFUL ENOUGH THAT IS THAT IT HAS THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT COULD PLAUSIBLY PRODUCE CENTERINGS THEN AT LEAST ITS A POSSIBILITYHOW WOULD WE KNOW THE SHORT ANSWERS WE WOULDN'T WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING WE WE HOW COULD WE KNOW IF IT'S EXPERIENCING ITS OWN EXISTENCE OR IF IT'S JUST REALLY GOOD AT ACTING AS IF IT DOES TOTALLY I PREDICT WE WILL GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE NO ONE CAN TRULY SAY IF IT'S SENTIENT OR NOT MAYBE IT'LL BE FIFTY YEARS OR WHATEVER WE'LL GET TO THE POINT WHEREIT'S REALLY GOOD AT SIMULATING SENTIMENT IT MIGHT HAVE IT BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA OF ITS ACTUALLY CONSCIOUS OF ITS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING ITS OWN EXISTENCE OR IF IT'S JUST DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB AT SIMULATING IT I'LL TELL YOU HOW BECAUSE BEING A TECHNICAL EXPERT DOESN'T GIVE YOU CRITICAL THINKING SKILLSNOR DOES IT GIVE YOU KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERT TASTES OUTSIDE OF YOUR AREA YOU KNOW OF FOCUS AND SO THE SKY CAN BE A VERY COMPETENT COMPUTER PROGRAMME AND DO TECHNICALLY WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE'S GOING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT HYPERACTIVE AGENCY DETECTION RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT LEMOYNE IS NOT ASERIOUS OR THAT HE THAT HE'S A HOAX OR HE'S GOT SOME ULTERIOR MOTIVE BUT I WHO KNOWS I WILL NEVER KNOW IT WHAT HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES BUT I JUST TAKE PEOPLE AT THEIR AT THEIR WORD UNLESS HAVE A REASON NOT TO IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT HE FELL FOR FELL FOR THE END OF THE ALLUSION HERE BUT IT DID THE LESSONS HERE AS WELL SOLIKE WHAT WHEN PEOPLE ASK WILL WE ACCEPT ROBOTS AND IN THE FUTURE AS HUMAN MY NATURE'S APTS OF FREAK AND LUTELY
