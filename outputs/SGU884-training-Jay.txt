I WILL START BY SAYING THAT SOMEHOW THE MIRACLE OF JUST MISSING CERTAIN PIECES OF REALITY I'D KNOW ABOUT THIS AT ALL AND I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I LIVE ON THE INNER AND AT MY JOB IS ENTERED AT BAST AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SOMETHING CALLED A VIRTUAL INFLUENCER EXISTEDAND I WANT TO SAY I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT VIRTUAL INFLUENCES WHAT ARE THEY THEY ARE THEIR PERSON IS THAT ARE CREATED BY A PERSON OR A TEAM OF PEOPLE THAT YOU'LL MIMIC REAL PEOPLE AT YOU I SAY THAT THEY THEY MIMIC REAL PEOPLE BECAUSE SOME OF THESE VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS THEY LOOK ALMOST REALOTHERS CAN HAVE AN ENEMY LOOK TO THEM OR AND YET OTHERS HAVE EXAGGERATED FEATURES WHICH ARE GET INTO THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY THESE VIRTUAL INFLUENCES ARE ESSENTIALLY DOING THE SAME THINGS THAT REAL PEOPLE DO ON LINE BUT THAT'S JUST IT THEY'RE NOT REAL PEOPLE THEY ARE CONSTRUCT THEY'RE MADE UP BY OTHER PEOPLESO THERE ARE A LOT OF THESE VIRTUAL INFLUENCES OUT THERE AND SOME HAVE EARNED LARGE FOLLOWINGS WHICH I WILL WHEN I DESCRIBE THIS TO YOU I IMAGINE THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS WILL GET BLOWN AWAY LIKE I WASN'T HOW BIG THESE FOLLOWINGS CAN GET EVEN THOUGH THESE PERSONALITIESAT THEIR CORE THEIR COMPUTER GENERATED RIGHT THROUGH THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK THE VITIOS THAT YOU SEE THIS IS ALL COMPUTER GENERATED BY BY PEOPLE TO PRETEND IN IT IN A WAY THAT IT'S A REAL PERSON EVEN THOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AUDIENCE KNOWS IT'S NOT A REAL PERSON THE WHOLE GAME HERE IS TO ACT AND PRETEND LIKE ITS A REAL PERSONTHE CONTENT THAT THESE VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS HAVE IS SIMILAR TO CONTENT CREATED BY REAL PEOPLE THEY HAVE YOU TWO VIDIOS TONS OF PICTURES OF THEMSELVES DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS ALL OVER THE WORLD THEY ARE FOUND ON ALL SOCIAL MEDIATE PLATFORMS SO THAT THE SHORTHAND OF THINKING ABOUT THIS ISTHERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THESE AVATARS AND THEIR INDIVIDUAL THEY HAVE NAMES AND THEY HAVE PERSONALITIES AND THEY HAVE RECOGNISABLE FACES AND VOICES AND IN EVERYTHING THAT MAKES THEM UNIQUE OR IT MAKES A HUMAN BEING UNIQUE THEY HAVE IT AS WELL SO THAT WE GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES THE FIRST ONE THAT WAS CREATED GOES BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTHE CHARACTER IS CALLED HAD SUNNY MIKO THIS CHARACTER STARTED OFF LITERALLY AS A VOICE CHANGING SOPHOMORE BUT WHEN THEY PACKAGED THE SOPHOMORE THEY CAME UP WITH LIKE THIS CHARACTER YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD KINDER REPRESENT THE SOPHOMORE AND SINCE ITS CREATION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THIS EVOLVED THISIT IS CHARACTER INTO A POPULAR PERSONALITY EVEN THOUGH HAD SOONER ITS VIRTUAL PEOPLE PAID TO GO TO HER CONCERTS IN THE REAL WORLD SO WE HAVE NOW THE VERY FIRST ONE THAT PROBABLY CAME INTO EXISTENCE ENDED UP BEING LEGITIMATELY A HUGE MONEY EARNING ENTITYAND AGAIN THERE IS NO PERSON REALLY BEHIND US IT'S PROBABLY A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE CREATING ALL THIS CONTENT AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO THIS THIS VIRTUAL CHARACTER THERE'S REAL MONEY BEHIND THIS AND SO THAT THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT THAT THEIR WHOLE GAME IS THIS LIKE THAT THIS CREATE THESE PERSON IS THAT THEY CREATE SOLET ME GO THROUGH A FEW MORE GIVING OTHER EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S OUT THERE SO THIS OTHER
